What you need to install/change

If you use non arch-based distro, change some aliases in fish. Also there are
two versions of vim directory. .vim you need to copy in your home directory. And
all directories in config fonder clone to .config folder or another dotfiles
directory.

So you need to install:

neovim(nvim),
vim,
helix,
ranger,
vifm,
hyprland (and all hypr ecosystem programs),
waybar,
swaybg,
catppuccin-cursors (I use catppuccin-mocha-dark),
starship,
fish,
kitty,
mako for notifications
hy3 plugin for hyprland,
MonoLisa nerd font,
cmus and cava for music,
rofi-wayland and wofi for menus,
ble.sh for bash autocompletions,
nwg-drawer and nwg-dock-hyprland for dock
in firefox I use catppuccin-mocha theme and userstyles via stylus. For tabs
newtab extention,
also I use tokyo-night, catppuccin and austronaut themes for sddm
